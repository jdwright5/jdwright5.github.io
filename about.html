<h1>Hi, I'm Jonathan</h1>
<p>I'm a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm majoring in journalism with a certificate in digital studies. I switched to a plant-based diet four months ago after being vegetarian for about a year. I made the switch in order to improve my health and athletic performance. In my free time I like to run, lift weights, and play sports. I've found that switching to a plant-based diet has improved my stamina, strength, and overall energy levels. Everyone should give it a try!</p>
